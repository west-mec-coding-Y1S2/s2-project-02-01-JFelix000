            <P>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. They did the job with no damage to my garage and
                cleaned it all up that same day. Great service.</P>

        <blockquote>
            <P>Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide an estimate for its removal. They did the
                job fast and at the lowest bid. I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.</P>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. They took extra care not to disturb
                my lawn and garden. I highly recommend their service.</p>

<!-- Under this section I seperated the p tags so that they could appear in two different paragraphs, and it was important to have an inline image with the alt set to Jedds Tree Care so that in the image it says exactly that. This is crucial to the overall look of the page -it is necessary to have alt text only when you need to put in words on the images.-->
